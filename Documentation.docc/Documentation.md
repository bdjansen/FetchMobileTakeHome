### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent about six hours on this project including testing and documentation.
* I spent 1 hour on initial architectural setup and data retrieval. The initial app just displayed the recipe list.
* I spent the next 2 hours setting up the viewmodels and views. This included decided which features I wanted to include within the app.
* I spent 2 hours strictly on image caching with CoreData. I initially started with NSCache to get it prepared, but this was my first time using CoreData to implement caching with persistence. I had to spend time learning how to use CoreData.
* I tried to write tests and I planned object functionality.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
* I initially wanted to use ``List`` instead of ``LazyVStack`` to receive the layout, but I was having trouble with the ``.task`` modifier on the appearance of the views.
